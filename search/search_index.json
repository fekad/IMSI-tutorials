Ghiringhelli</p> <p>Exploratory analyses make use of unsupervised learning techniques to extract information from unknown datasets. In this tutorial, we make use of some of the most popular clustering and dimension reduction algorithms to analyze a dataset composed of 82 octet-binary compounds.</p> <p>Launch </p>"},{"location":"#symbolic-regression-via-compressed-sensing-a-tutorial","title":"Symbolic regression via compressed sensing: a tutorial","text":"<p>Authors: Emre Ahmetcik, Angelo Ziletti, Runhai Ouyang, Luigi Sbail\u00f2, Matthias Scheffler and Luca M. Ghiringhelli</p> <p>In this tutorial we will show how to find descriptive parameters to predict materials properties using symbolic regrression combined with compressed sensing tools. The relative stability of the zincblende (ZB) versus rocksalt (RS) structure of binary materials is predicted and compared against a model trained with kernel ridge regression.</p> <p>Launch </p>"},{"location":"#introduction-to-clustering","title":"Introduction to clustering","text":"<p>Authors: Luigi Sbail\u00f2 and Luca M. Ghiringhelli</p> <p>In this tutorial, we introduce to the most popular clustering algorithms. We focus on partitioning, hierarchical and density-based clustering algorithms.

Ghiringhelli</p> <p>In this tutorial we will introduce decision trees. We go through a toy model introducing the SKLearn API. We then discuss piece by piece the different theoretical aspects of trees. We then move to training a regression tree and classification tree on different datasets related to materials science. We end the tutorial by covering random forests and bagging classifiers.</p> <p>Launch </p>"},{"location":"#kernel-ridge-regression-for-materials-property-prediction-a-tutorial-introduction","title":"Kernel Ridge Regression for Materials Property Prediction: A Tutorial Introduction","text":"<p>Authors: Marcel F. Langer</p> <p>In this tutorial, we'll explore the application of kernel ridge regression to the prediction of materials properties. We will begin with a largely informal, pragmatic introduction to kernel ridge regression, including a rudimentary implementation, in order to become familiar with the basic terminology and considerations. We will then discuss representations, and re-trace the NOMAD 2018 Kaggle challenge.</p> <p>Launch </p>"},{"location":"#querying-the-archive-and-performing-artificial-intelligence-modeling","title":"Querying the Archive and performing Artificial Intelligence modeling","text":"<p>Authors: Luigi Sbail\u00f2, Matthias Scheffler and Luca M.
